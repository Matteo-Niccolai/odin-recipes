        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Here is the <strong>best recipe</strong> in the world for a <strong><em>BISTECCA</em></strong> as good as the one of a <em>Chef</em> made.</p>
        <p>A difficult recipe with an elevate cost but with an <em>amazing</em> flavor.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meat:</strong> 1 (2 1/2 pound) choice or prime porterhouse steak</li>
                <li><strong>Lemon:</strong> 6 lemon wedges</li>
                <li><strong>Fresh herbs:</strong> 4 sprigs fresh rosemary, chopped</li>
                <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> 3 tablespoons Tuscan olive oil</li>
                <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> Moist, grey sea salt and freshly cracked pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Press chopped rosemary onto both sides of porterhouse steak; set onto a plate and allow to marinate at room temperature for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Start an outdoor grill using hardwood charcoal, such as hickory. When coals are white and glowing, arrange for high heat.</li>
                <li>Gently brush or rub olive oil onto steak, then season to taste with sea salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Place steak onto grill, and cook until a dark, golden brown (not burnt) crust forms, 5 to 10 minutes depending on thickness of meat. Turn over, and continue cooking until golden on the other side, 5 to 10 minutes more. When finished, place steak onto a platter, and allow to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>To serve, remove the two pieces of meat from the bone, and replace the bone onto the serving platter. Trim any unwanted fat from the round (tenderloin) steak, slice into 6 equal pieces at an angle to the grain, and fan out on one side of the bone. Slice the rectangular (loin) steak into 1/4-inch slices at an angle to the grain. Fan out on the other side of the bone. Finish by garnishing the platter with lemon wedges and a sprinkle of additional sea salt.</li>
            </ol>
